Gestor is an open-source app crafted to deliver personalized reports and offer greater lead management control for businesses, tailored to each client's needs. It's my interpretation and adaptation of the official [architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) guidelines provided by Google. 

## ‚ùóImportant to know
The application is currently under development.
The following technologies are being integrated into its framework:
- Local database integration using Room.
- SharedPreferences & DataStore.
- Code obfuscation through Proguard and R8 for increased security.
- UI testing.
- Multi-platform support.
